Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with either an "X" or an "O." The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to learn and quick to play, making it a favorite for all ages. While the game often ends in a draw with optimal play from both sides, it also provides opportunities for strategy and critical thinking. Tic Tac Toe can be played on paper, as a digital game, or even as a physical activity, making it a versatile and timeless pastime.
